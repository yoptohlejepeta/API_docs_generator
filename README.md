# API docs generator

Streamlit app for generating docs for API

## Libraries documentation

- [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/)
- [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/)
- [Reportlab](https://www.reportlab.com/docs/reportlab-userguide.pdf)

Originally I wanted to generate PDF file with [PyLaTeX](https://jeltef.github.io/PyLaTeX/current/index.html), but since I cant install latex on StreamlitCloud, I had to use Reportlab.
